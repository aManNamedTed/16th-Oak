I have learned a great deal from scratching out dayataparty 1.0. This is 2.0, in which the main story is maintained throughout the game.

The programming of this game will begin on December 22nd, 2015. I will organize tasks into an hour-by-hour schedule, expecting to finish
and release the game by 11:59PM PST December 25th, 2015. Check the story/backlogs/tasks files for information on these sprints.
