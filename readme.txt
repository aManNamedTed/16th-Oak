	[-] SAVE FUNCTION
	    	postpone: save file function will be made after a 
	    	sufficient amount the game has been developed.	
	    	note: the idea behind the save function is to use fstreams to 
	    	open a .txt file, commit game data to the file, then allow at the
	    	beginning of the game, to check if the user has a saved game file,
	    	then use that file to read information into the game, and will
	    	allow the user to continue playing from their previous saved
	    	game spot.
	[-] M-Rated easter-egg "fap" option for JGAL
