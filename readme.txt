Welcome to the 'Day at a Party' game repository! 'Day at a Party'
is a new game created November 3, 2015. I am working to have it
completed by December, 2015. My goal is to have it filled with 
60 minutes of play time, with several different paths to be taken.

Real-Time playable material:
	November  7, 2015, 3 minutes of playable material.
	November 17, 2015, 6 minutes of playable material.
