I have learned a great deal from scratching out dayataparty 1.0. This is 2.0, in which the main story is maintained throughout the game.
*I have also figured out how to keep the game in main() w/o depending on function->function story-directing

The programming of this game will begin on December 22nd, 2015. 
*I started programming this today, December 24th, 2015. around 12:00AM (not noon, midnight)

I will organize tasks into an hour-by-hour schedule, 
*I have not organized tasks into hour-by-hour, but I have general goals of where I need to be at certain times

I am expecting to finish and release the game by 11:59PM PST December 25th, 2015. 
*This is the only line that is still accurate

Check the story/backlogs/tasks files for information on these sprints.
*Check the tasks.txt file for more information. Right now, backlogs are redundant. the story is also helpful 
*in viewing progress, but not as helpful as the tasks.txt file.
