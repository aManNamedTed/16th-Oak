Background: I realized I had messed up by trying to implement too many features before actually finishing
the game. This is my second attempt at creating the story, from start to finish, and then actually
programming the entire game from start to finish, within 24 hours. So the goal here in dayata 2.0 is to
create the entire story, hopefully succeeding in 10 full minutes of play time. The story begins here:

________________________________________________________STORY___________________________________________
Level One:
    Upon stepping foot in your apartment after a long day at work, your home phone rings. You answer it, 
    and the voice on the other line says, "Dude! Party on 32nd and Elm! That cutie from your sociology 
    class is here!! You coming?" You are taken aback by the voice. It sounds familiar, but you're not 
    entirely sure who it is. "Who is this?" You ask, to which the voice says, "Richard! C'mon man! Work
    couldn't've been THAT bad! So are you coming or not??" You reply half-heartedly with a yes. Richard: 
    GOOD! It's still early--so you probably have an hour before we 'turn up.' I guess that's what this 
    generation's culture calls it nowadays. Nevertheless, I better see you here tonight!
    
Level Two:
    Upon hearing the new of an uproarious shindig occurring in the near future, you find yourself tired,
    surprised, and other words expressing mood.
      >Shower
        /set music, during an ad you hear of a medical discovery by a Myrtle Wexington
      >Get Dressed
      >Brush Teeth
      >Leave
    [you will not be allowed to leave until you have completed all of the above]
    
Level Three:
    Upon arriving at 32nd and Elm, you see a beautiful two story house. Redwood porch on the right side
    of the house. Garage/basement combo on the left. You walk up to the house as a familiar face rushes
    frantically out of the front door. You begin up the steps as she hurries down them. Without missing
    a beat, she starts, "Hey /name/! You haven't seen Ron anywhere, have you??" 
    >no
      You shake your head, no. She nods and says, "well if you see him, be sure to let me know, okay??"
      She hurries off around the corner to the gas station. 
      *you*: Oh what's her NAME? I remember we had World History in high school, but ugh, I can't
      remember her name for the life of me. And Ron? I also remember him from high school. He was 
      exceptional at hyper-realistic art. Hmm. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for him.
    
    You turn around to open the door, as-- *CRASH* --a noise comes from inside the garage. You open the
    door and the bass of the music assault your senses. 
    
    You are in the hallway by the front door. There are stairs to the left, a room to the right, and music
    coming from the end of the hallway.
        (use [go to] and an area to go to that area)
    Areas:
        stairs
        room
        music
        
    >go to stairs
        (WHILE HAVEN'T FOUND RON)
            Upon making the turn up the stairs, a large man in a suit stops you in your tracks.
            Guard: Name?
            you: uh.. /name/?
            The guard searches for your name...
            Guard: You're not on the list.
            The guard turns you around and sends you back downstairs.
            
    >go to room
        You knock on the door.
        (WHILE HAVEN'T TRIED TO OPEN BATHROOM)
            ???: Go away.
            You turn around and go back to where you were.
        (WHEN YOU HAVE TRIED TO OPEN BATHROOM)
        . . .
        The door cracks open and a head peeks out at you.
        you: ... Hello?
        ???: /name/?! Oh my! Hi!
        The girl grabs your wrist and pulls you into the room, slamming the door behind you.
        ???: /name/! I'm so glad to see you! This dumb party my sister threw is SOOO lame.
        you: ...?
        ???: Oh.. uh?
        She notices your confusion.
        ???: Myrtle? From organic chem?
        You realize who the familiar face from earlier was. Heather! The T.A from World History.
        Her and her sister come from an iconic family. Dad is the head of Oncology at the local
        hospital, while Mom is a data analyst for Google. Heather is known for being the ONLY
        student in county history to score a 5 on the AP World History test. While Myrtle was..
        *flashback*: a medical breakthrough was discovered today by local student, Myrtle Wexington.
        
        In a fit of excitement, you almost shout,
        you: Myrtle!!
        you: You were on the news like, a half hour ago!
        you: You made some sort of medical breakthrough, progressing--
        Myrtle: Yeah yeah. I know, 'progressing mankind towards superhuman capabilities.'
        
        You're confused why she seems disappointed.
        
        Myrtle: Literally everyone at the party has been raving to me about how 'amazing' I am. It's
        Myrtle: not really that amazing. Professor Treuse just made a stupid error in his modeling
        Myrtle: of five-alpha dihydroprogesterone. He forgot the damn thirtieth carbon
        Myrtle: resulting in an error with his final calculation. I fixed it, and it just so happens
        Myrtle: when that specific carbon interacts with an arterial graft, the body
        Myrtle: merges almost immediately with the artificial limb. Cool, whatever.
        
        you: *in awe*
        
        Myrtle: Umm.. anyway! What's up?
        
        >ask about getting into the garage
            Myrtle: Oh of course! Actually, Richard told me earlier that when you get here, to let
            Myrtle: you know he'd be in the garage. Here, take the key.
            
            *You've gained the garage key!*
            
            You head back to the hallway.
    >go to music
    

      >Heather paces around frantically as if searching for something. Maybe you should help her?
        >help Heather
          ???: ...hey-- Hey! Have you seen my friend, Ron?
          ???: 
      >Myrtle
        >talk to Myrtle
      >Willow
        >talk to Willow
      >Ron
        >open bathroom door
      >Liz
