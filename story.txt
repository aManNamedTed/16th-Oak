Background: I realized I had messed up by trying to implement too many features before actually finishing
the game. This is my second attempt at creating the story, from start to finish, and then actually
programming the entire game from start to finish, within 24 hours. So the goal here in dayata 2.0 is to
create the entire story, hopefully succeeding in 10 full minutes of play time. The story begins here:
________________________________________TUTORIAL________________________________________________________
Classic tutorial, no skipping, primarily the tutorial from the last attempt at this game. Can be found
in /mainlib. 
Also add details about these things:
[] include something about using the new 'go to + area' mechanic.
[] include about how there are moments where there will be noise, so use headphones, and be considerate
    if you're in a setting where others can readily hear what your computer will put out
[] i think? include something about the delay setting, in which no input is required

Get_Name:
    It's Friday December 25th, 2015. 
    
    *ding ding*
    
    The train bell wakes you as you realize you've reached your stop.
    
    You leave the train and begin your four minute walk back to your apartment complex.
    
    (insert some Jolly Oxen here using beeps and frequencies)
    
    Wasn't that nice?
    
    Anyway.
    
    You see a strange man standing outside of your apartment complex.
    
    As you approach, the man notices you and stands in front of the door.
    
    Strange Man: "Name?"
        >name[]
            The man hesitates for a second, looking you up and down.
            
            ...
            
            if(name == "david amante")
            {
                Strange Man: "Apologies, sir. It's you, from the past. It's 3:09AM PST on"
                Strange Man: "December 12, 2015. You got this crazy dumb idea to try to"
                Strange Man: "release this game in thirteen days. I mean, it's on GitHub,"
                Strange Man: "the edits are there. The archiving. Dude you're nuts for"
                Strange Man: "deciding to finish this game in 13 days. I mean, disregarding the fact"
                Strange Man: "that you have that hash table project due in 8 days, and a calculus I final"
                Strange Man: "in 2 days, oh and the CIS in-class final is on the 17th, that final you"
                Strange Man: "should be studying for.. Well I mean. Priorities, right? Go you. Or well,"
                Strange Man: "go me? It's late and you/i/we're tired. Good luck finishing this." 
                Strange Man: "Thanks me. Or you. Us. This is weird. Go on in. Have fun."
            }
            else
            {
                #you are not him (if you put david amante as the name of your char, special stuff happens)
                Holding a finger to his earpiece, he says,
                
                Strange Man: "01111001 01101111 01110101"
                delay(1 second)
                Strange Man: "01100001 01110010 01100101"
                delay(1 second)
                Strange Man: "01101110 01101111 01110100"
                delay(.7)
                Strange Man: "01101000 01101001 01101101"
                
                Strange Man: "My apologies. You must be one of the other 9 people that live here."
                Strange Man: "Please. After you."
                
                The man holds the door open as you enter.
            }
    ------------------------------------------------------
Level One:
    Upon stepping foot in your apartment after a long day at work, your home phone rings. You answer it, 
    and the voice on the other line says, "Dude! Party on 32nd and Elm! That cutie from your sociology 
    class is here!! You coming?" You are taken aback by the voice. It sounds familiar, but you're not 
    entirely sure who it is. "Who is this?" You ask, to which the voice says, "Richard! C'mon man! Work
    couldn't've been THAT bad! So are you coming or not??" You reply half-heartedly with a yes. Richard: 
    GOOD! It's still early--so you probably have an hour before we 'turn up.' I guess that's what this 
    generation's culture calls it nowadays. Nevertheless, I better see you here tonight!
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level Two:
    Upon hearing the new of an uproarious shindig occurring in the near future, you find yourself tired,
    surprised, and other words expressing mood.
      >Shower
        //set music, during an ad you hear of a medical discovery by a Myrtle Wexington
      >Get Dressed
      >Brush Teeth
      >Leave
    [you will not be allowed to leave until you have completed all of the above]
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level Three:
    [ALSO, there is a flagpole bearing a bright yellow flag with a happy face on it]
    Upon arriving at 32nd and Elm, you see a beautiful two story house. Redwood porch on the right side
    of the house. Garage/basement combo on the left. You walk up to the house as a familiar face rushes
    frantically out of the front door. You begin up the steps as she hurries down them. Without missing
    a beat, she starts, "Hey /name/! You haven't seen Ron anywhere, have you??" 
    >no
      You shake your head, no. She nods and says, "well if you see him, be sure to let me know, okay??"
      She hurries off around the corner to the gas station. 
      *you*: Oh what's her NAME? I remember we had World History in high school, but ugh, I can't
      remember her name for the life of me. And Ron? I also remember him from high school. He was 
      exceptional at hyper-realistic art. Hmm. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for him.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    You turn around to open the door, as-- *CRASH* --a raucous noise comes from inside the garage. 
    You open the door and the bass of the music assault your senses. 
    
    You are in the hallway by the front door. There is a set of stairs, a door to the left, a room to 
    the right, and music coming from the end of the hallway.
    
    You also notice a poster by the foot of the stairs.
    
    Areas:
        poster
        door
        stairs
        room
        music
        
    >go to poster 
    {THE WAY THIS WILL WORK IS IT SHOWS 3 AT A TIME, AFTER YOU FINISH THE TOP-MOST TASK, A BOOL WILL 
     SWAP VALUES, MAKING THE TOP TASK DISAPPEAR, AND THE NEW (3RD) BOTTOM TASK TO APPEAR. THE USER
     SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS POSTER FROM ANYWHERE.
     either:
    1.  CONSIDERING IT NOW, I THINK I WILL MAKE IT BE SOME HANDOUT FROM SOMEONE AT THE PARTY, IN WHICH
        YOU TAKE THE POSTER AND FOLD IT AND PUT IT INTO YOUR POCKET,
    2.  OR IT WILL JUST BE A POSTER THAT IS CONSPICUOUSLY ON EVERY FLOOR
    3.  OR IT WILL BE ONLY ON THE FIRST FLOOR, (NOT IN BASEMENT/NOT IN SECOND FLOOR
    4.  OR MAYBE IT WILL JUST BE A COMMAND THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE, "what do i do", WHERE IT WILL CALL
        THE NARRATOR IN WHICH THEY WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO

    >go to door
        (WHILE HAVEN'T TALKED TO MYRTLE)
        It's locked. You go back to where you were.
        (AFTER YOU HAVE TALKED TO MYRTLE)
        Using the garage key, the door clicks open. You step into a dimly lit stairwell.
        //maybe if you beat the game, a bool will flip where a secret door is there, hiding '(idkyet)'
        
        Areas:
        garage
        
        >go to garage
            You descend the staircase and open the door to the garage. You see two cars to the right of you,
            a door to the left, and a large shelving structure behind you. In front of you, there
            are two people sitting in lawn chairs looking into a room separated by glass.
            
            Areas:
                cars
                door
                shelves
                people
            
            >go to cars
                There are two cars, side by side. A midnight blue Maserati Granturismo MC Stradale. Absolutely
                stunning. You circle the car twice. No license plates. Keeping it company is an onyx black Rolls 
                Royce Wraith with gray trim. It's so shiny. Almost.. abnormally shiny? Too shiny. It's weird.
                Hmm.. Again, no plates. Odd.
                You return to where you were.
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            >go to door
                (WHILE HAVEN'T TALKED TO PEOPLE)
                There is a red light on right above the doorway. Underneath it reads,
                "Do not disturb" 
                Maybe it's a sign to not go in there.

            >go to shelves
                Before you are two book shelves. One side filled with house and art paint, and painting books,
                while the other side is filled with hand and power tools. Looks like your everyday workbench.
                You turn back around.
            
            >go to people

    >go to stairs
        (WHILE HAVEN'T TALKED TO LIZ) 
            Upon making the turn up the stairs, a large man in a suit stops you in your tracks.
            Guard: Name?
        //maybe i'll throw shoutouts if you entered certain names, BUT EYES ON THE PRIZE FOR NOW.
            you: uh.. /name/?
            The guard searches for your name...
            Guard: You're not on the list.
            The guard turns you around and sends you back downstairs.

    >go to room
        You knock on the door.
        (WHILE HAVEN'T VISITED THE BATHROOM)
            ???: Go away.
            You turn around and go back to where you were.
        
        (WHEN YOU HAVE VISITED THE BATHROOM)
        You knock on the door.
        . . .
        The door cracks open and a head peeks out at you.
        you: ... Hello?
        ???: /name/?! Oh my! Hi!
        The girl grabs your wrist and pulls you into the room, slamming the door behind you.
        ???: /name/! I'm so glad to see you! This dumb party my sister threw is SOOO lame.
        you: ...?
        ???: Oh.. uh?
        
        She notices your confusion.
        
        ???: I'm uh.. We had organic chem together.
        You realize who the familiar face from earlier was. Heather! The T.A from World History.
        Her and her sister come from an iconic family. Dad is the head of Oncology at the local
        hospital, while Mom is a data analyst for Google. Heather is known for being the ONLY
        student in county history to score a 5 on the AP World History test. While Myrtle was..
        *flashback*: a medical breakthrough was discovered today by local student, Myrtle Wexington.
        
        In a fit of excitement, you almost shout,
        you: Myrtle!!
        you: You were on the news like, a half hour ago!
        you: You made some sort of medical breakthrough, progressing--
        Myrtle: Yeah yeah. I know, 'progressing mankind towards superhuman capabilities.'
        
        You're confused why she seems disappointed.
        
        Myrtle: Literally everyone at the party has been raving to me about how 'amazing' I am. It's
        Myrtle: not really that amazing. Professor Treuse just made a stupid error in his modeling
        Myrtle: of five-alpha dihydroprogesterone. He forgot the damn thirtieth carbon
        Myrtle: resulting in an error with his final calculation. I fixed it, and it just so happens
        Myrtle: when that specific carbon interacts with an arterial graft, the body
        Myrtle: merges almost immediately with the artificial limb. Cool, whatever.
        
        you: *in awe*
        
        Myrtle: Umm.. yeah. Oh! Richard told me that when you showed up, to let you know he'd be in the
        Myrtle: garage. 
        
        *You've gained the garage key!*
            
        Myrtle: It's through the door in the hallway. Heather likes to lock it during parties 
        Myrtle: so no one bothers Liz. 
        
            ['expletive' in morse code]
        
        Myrtle: Like my new ringtone?! It's a word that holds 'deer' to my heart. Haha, get it? Deer. 
        Myrtle: Because 'deer' reminds me of 'moose,' and 'moose' and 'morse' are just one letter away
        Myrtle: from each other. And you know what letter they're differing? R! And THAT is the gas
        Myrtle: constant made famous by French chemist, Henri Victor Regnault! Haha! Clever, right?
        Myrtle: Anyway! I'm gonna take this. Make sure Richard is alright for me, okay?
        Myrtle: He seemed pretty tipsy last I saw him.
    
        You reassure her that you will take good care of Richard, and head back to the hallway.
        
        (AFTER VISITING MYRTLE AND VIEWING THE CUT SCENE)
        You knock on the door.
        
        Myrtle: I'm busy!
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    >go to music
        Arriving in the heart of the party, you see a beer pong table, a kitchen area, a large group of 
        people gathered around a T.V, and a room toward your right.
        Areas:
            beer pong table
            kitchen
            T.V
            room
            
            >go to beer pong table
                As you approach the table, a ball flies across the table, sinking into a cup. A collective
                cheer erupts from the spectators as the losing team downs a beer in unison.
                Boy: Hey! No randoms.
                You retreat back to the music.
            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            >go to kitchen
                Upon sneaking past the beer pong crowd, you arrive at an almost industrial size kitchen.
                Marble countertops, sapphire trim, and TWO refrigerators. TWO. To your right is an
                inconspicuous table of three. Each person has their left fist outreached, and a glass of 
                something in their right.
            
                Girl: Hey! Welcome to the designated driver table. We like to keep things fun without drinking.
                Girl: Unfortunately, we're up to capacity for the rest of the night. Three players only. Sorry!
                You retreat back to the kitchen area.
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            >go to T.V
                Sports Anchor: The thirty, the twenty, the ten, touchdown!!
                Sports Anchor: A 97 yard kick return for a touchdown!
                College Kids: (collective cheering)
                It seems they are busy.
                You retreat to the music.
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            >go to the room
                Upon reaching the room, you hear noises coming from inside.
                ???: *heaving*
                ???: *whimpering*
                ???: *more heaving*
                you: You alright in there?

                ???: Ghejkftkejkltjtkjlahejkjlkjaljiljtssjhheerrr--
                ???: *heaving*
                You slowly back away from the door back to the music.
